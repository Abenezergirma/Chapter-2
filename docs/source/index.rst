Preâ€‘departure Flight Planning and Risk Assessment for UAM/UAS Operations under Battery Constraint
===================================

   
Overview
--------

The goal of this project is to develop a decision-making framework for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) operations, focusing on enhancing collision safety and battery energy use. The framework features a novel two-layer algorithm: the upper layer performs strategic de-confliction, and the lower layer handles prognostics and decision-making for mission execution. The following figure shows the overall structure and working principle of the developed framework.
