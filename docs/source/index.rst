Overview
--------

The goal of this project is to develop a decision-making framework for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) operations, focusing on enhancing collision safety and battery energy use. The framework features a novel two-layer algorithm: the upper layer performs strategic de-confliction, and the lower layer handles prognostics and decision-making for mission execution. The following figure shows the overall structure and working principle of the developed framework.

Package Delivery Scenario   
--------
The scenario we used to implement the framework and test its performance is designed for a package delivery application and is implemented for the University Park area of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan region. It includes three depots from which aircraft are expected to take off, and random destination places can be assigned within the $7 km^2$ rectangular area.
