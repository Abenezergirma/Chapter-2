Preâ€‘departure Flight Planning and Risk Assessment for UAM/UAS Operations under Battery Constraint
===================================



Overview
--------

This repository contains the implementation of a decision-making framework for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) operations, focusing on enhancing collision safety and battery energy use. The framework features a novel two-layer algorithm: the upper layer performs strategic de-confliction, and the lower layer handles prognostics and decision-making for mission execution.

Package Delivery Scenario   
--------
The scenario we used to implement the framework and test its performance is designed for a package delivery application and is implemented for the University Park area of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan region. It includes three depots from which aircraft are expected to take off, and random destination places can be assigned within the $7 km^2$ rectangular area.

Package Delivery Scenario   
--------


**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
