2. Ensure you have the required software dependencies (MATLAB, Python, Simulink, etc.).
3. Set up the project environment following the guidelines in the project documentation.

Guideline 
----------------

1. Start by running `main.m` to perform trajectory planning and energy requirement analysis.
2. Use `generateEnergyRequirement.m` to simulate the UAV and determine energy requirements.
3. Analyze battery prognostics using the Python library in `Battery Prognostics`.
4. Develop reward functions using `RewardFunctionExperiments`.
5. Run the `Main.py` script to make decisions based on risk assessment.
