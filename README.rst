Energy-Efficient Trajectory Planning and Mission Feasibility Assessment Framework for Drone Package Delivery Operations
=======================================

This repository contains the implementation of a decision-making framework for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) operations, focusing on enhancing collision safety and battery energy use. The framework features a novel two-layer algorithm: the upper layer performs strategic de-confliction, and the lower layer handles prognostics and decision-making for mission execution.
